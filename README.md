# DeepStock ðŸ“Š 

**DeepStock** is a deep learning framework for **stock price prediction and forecasting** using LSTMs and feature engineering.  
It supports training, evaluation, and visualization of model performance with **residuals, loss curves, and volatility indicators**.

## Features

- Preprocessing with **MinMaxScaler** and rolling features (MA10, MA20, MA50, returns).  

- Sequence generation for supervised learning on time series.  
- LSTM-based forecasting with:
  - Model checkpointing  
  - Early stopping & learning rate scheduling  
- Evaluation metrics:
  - MAE, RMSE, RÂ², MAPE  
  - Directional Accuracy (%)  
  - Bias correction  
- Visualizations:
  - Actual vs. Predicted prices with **forecasts**  
  - Residuals (Actual âˆ’ Predicted)  
  - Smoothed training/validation loss curves  
  - Volatility indicators (rolling std & Bollinger Band width)

## Installation

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blkpvnthr/deepstock.git
cd deepstock
```
Create a virtual environment:
macOS/Linux
``` bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Windows
``` bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Prepare your data

Store your stock data as CSV or fetch it directly with yfinance.
Each DataFrame should include:

- Close
- Daily Return
- MA_10
- MA_20
- MA_50

1. Run training + forecasting
``` bash
   python prediction.py
```

This will:
- Train or load an existing model per ticker.
- Save checkpoints to checkpoints/.
- Generate predictions and forecasts (60-day & 6-month).
- Save plots into results/plots/.
